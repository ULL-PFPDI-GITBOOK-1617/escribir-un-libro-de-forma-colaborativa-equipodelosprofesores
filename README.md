# My Awesome Book# So Long Marianne

### Leonard Cohen

> Come over to the window, my little darling

> I'd like to try to read your palm

> I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy

> Before I let you take me home

> Now so long, Marianne

> It's time that we began to laugh

> And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

> Well, you know that I love to live with you

> But you make me forget so very much

> I forget to pray for the angels

> And then the angels forget to pray for us

> Now so long, Marianne

> It's time that we began to laugh

> And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

> We met when we were almost young

> Deep in the green lilac park

> You held on to me like I was a crucifix

> As we went kneeling through the dark

> Oh, so long, Marianne

> It's time that we began to laugh

> And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

> Your letters,â€¦

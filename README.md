# So Long Marianne

### Leonard Cohen

> Come over to the window, my little darling

> I'd like to try to read your palm

> I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy

> Before I let you take me home

> Now so long, Marianne

> It's time that we began to laugh

> And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

> Well, you know that I love to live with you

> But you make me forget so very much

> I forget to pray for the angels

> And then the angels forget to pray for us

> Now so long, Marianne

> It's time that we began to laugh

> And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

> We met when we were almost young

> Your letters,…

>Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws

>Oh, I want you, I want you, I want you

>On a chair with a dead magazine

>In the cave at the tip of the lilly

>In some hallway where love's never been

>On a bed where the moon has been sweating

>In a cry filled with footsteps and sand

>I, I-I-I

>Take this waltz, take this waltz

>Take its broken waist in your hand

>This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz

>With its very own breath of brandy and Death

>Dragging its tail in the sea

>There's…
